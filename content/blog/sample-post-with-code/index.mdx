import Underlined from '../../../src/components/Underlined.js';

A sample blog post with embedded react components and code syntax highlighting with <Underlined href={'https://prismjs.com/'} text={'Prism'} />

## Sample code

Create a directory and `.yml` workflow file. This will contain the Github Action Job Defintion (a.k.a workflow instructions).

```powershell
mkdir .github/workflows
cd .github/workflows
New-Item main.yml
```

Once you've created `main.yml` add the following code.

```yml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Builds and Passes on ${{ matrix.node }} and ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [12]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Use node ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org
```
